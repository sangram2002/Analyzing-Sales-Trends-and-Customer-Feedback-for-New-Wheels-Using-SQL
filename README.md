# Analyzing-Sales-Trends-and-Customer-Feedback-for-New-Wheels-Using-SQL

I led a project to address declining sales and customer acquisition issues for New-Wheels. By organizing and analyzing unstructured data using advanced SQL techniques, I provided critical insights into sales trends and customer feedback. The project involved data integration, mathematical calculations, and creating visualizations for a comprehensive Quarterly Business Report. My work enabled the leadership team to make data-driven decisions, ultimately aiming to improve customer satisfaction and boost sales. This project highlighted my expertise in SQL, data analysis, and problem-solving, contributing to the strategic growth of the company.

The Business report and the supporting jupyter notebook is attached.
